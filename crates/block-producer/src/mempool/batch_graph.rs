// BATCH GRAPH
// ================================================================================================

/// Tracks the dependencies between batches, transactions and their parents.
///
/// Batches are inserted with their transaction and parent transaction sets which defines the edges
/// of the dependency graph. Batches are initially inserted in a pending state while we wait on
/// their proofs to be generated. The dependencies are still tracked in this state.
///
/// Batches can then be promoted to ready by [submitting their proofs](Self::submit_proof) once
/// available. Proven batches are considered for inclusion in blocks once _all_ parent batches have
/// been selected.
///
/// Committed batches (i.e. included in blocks) may be [pruned](Self::prune_committed) from the
/// graph to bound the graph's size.
///
/// Batches may also be outright [purged](Self::remove_batches) from the graph. This is useful for
/// batches which may have become invalid due to external considerations e.g. expired transactions.
