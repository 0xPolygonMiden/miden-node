# Miden node store

The **Store** maintains the state of the chain. It serves as the "source of truth" for the chain - i.e., if it is not in
the store, the node does not consider it to be part of the chain.
Incoming requests to the store are trusted because they are validated in the RPC component.

**Store** is one of components of the [Miden node](..).
