# Local Network Development

Use this guide to start a disposable Miden network for local development and testing. The provided Docker Compose setup
includes a sequencer, three validators, a transaction prover, a network transaction builder, and optional block
explorer, faucet, monitoring, and trace services, so you can develop against a working environment without wiring the
network services manually.

The Compose model lives in `docker-compose.yml` and uses profiles for optional explorer, faucet, telemetry, and
monitoring services. The guide uses `make` targets as shorthand for the underlying Docker image builds and Docker
Compose commands; check the `Makefile` when you need the exact command.

This is not a production deployment guide and it is not the path for independent full node runners on an existing
network.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker with Docker Compose support
- `make`

## Check Out a Version

Prefer a release tag when testing against released artifacts. Use a branch when developing against the current
repository state.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xMiden/node.git
cd node
git checkout <release-tag-or-branch>
```

## Run a Published Version

New releases are also published as Compose applications in the GitHub container registry. With Docker Compose 2.34.0 or
later, start the core local network directly from the release artifact:

```bash
RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z
COMPOSE_APPLICATION=oci://ghcr.io/0xmiden/miden-local-network:${RELEASE_TAG}

docker compose -f "${COMPOSE_APPLICATION}" up -d
docker compose -f "${COMPOSE_APPLICATION}" logs -f
docker compose -f "${COMPOSE_APPLICATION}" down -v
```

The application includes an OpenTelemetry Collector that receives traces from the Miden services. Enable the optional
faucet, Midenscan explorer, Tempo, Grafana, and network monitor services with Compose profiles:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f "${COMPOSE_APPLICATION}" \
  --profile faucet \
  --profile explorer \
  --profile telemetry \
  --profile monitor \
  up -d
```

When the telemetry profile is enabled, the collector forwards traces to Tempo. To send a copy to another OTLP/gRPC
endpoint, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`; this works with or without the telemetry profile:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://collector.example.com:4317 \
docker compose -f "${COMPOSE_APPLICATION}" up -d
```

The genesis configuration can be replaced with the same Compose override used for a repository checkout.

## Local Network Commands

Build the images after checkout or whenever you need fresh local images. The Makefile targets enable the `telemetry` and
`monitor` profiles. The local network stores data in the `node-data` Docker volume; `local-network-down` keeps that
data, while `local-network-delete` removes it.

```bash
# Build the Docker images used by the local network.
make local-network-build

# Optionally build for a specific Docker platform.
make local-network-build DOCKER_PLATFORM=linux/arm64

# Start the local network.
make local-network-up

# Follow container logs.
#
# Logs are useful for startup checks; use Tempo traces for request-level debugging.
make local-network-logs

# Stop the local network, preserving the local chain data volume.
make local-network-down

# Stop the local network and delete the local chain data volume.
make local-network-delete
```

After `make local-network-delete`, run `make local-network-up` to bootstrap a fresh local chain.

## Exposed Endpoints

The bundled Caddy router listens on port 80 and routes `.localhost` host names to services on the Compose network. Names
under `.localhost` resolve to the local loopback address, so they require no hosts-file or external DNS changes. Port 80
must be available on the host.

Existing direct ports remain available for native gRPC clients, automation, and compatibility:

| Service            | Routed URL                          | Direct address                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| RPC API (gRPC-Web) | `http://rpc.localhost`              | `localhost:57291` for native gRPC |
| Transaction prover | `http://prover.localhost`           | Not published directly            |
| Note transport     | `http://ntl.localhost`              | `localhost:57292` for native gRPC |
| Faucet frontend    | `http://faucet.localhost`           | `http://localhost:8081`           |
| Faucet API         | `http://faucet.localhost/api`       | `http://localhost:8000`           |
| Block explorer     | `http://explorer.localhost`         | `http://localhost:8080`           |
| Explorer GraphQL   | `http://explorer.localhost/graphql` | `http://localhost:8199/graphql`   |
| Grafana            | `http://grafana.localhost`          | `http://localhost:3000`           |
| Network monitor    | `http://monitor.localhost`          | `http://localhost:3001`           |
| Tempo HTTP API     | `http://tempo.localhost`            | `http://localhost:3200`           |
| Tempo OTLP gRPC    | Not routed                          | `localhost:4317`                  |

## Block Explorer

Enable the `explorer` profile to run the Gateway FM Midenscan frontend, backend, indexer, database, and database
migration:

```bash
docker compose --profile explorer up -d
```

The indexer reads from the local sequencer and persists its state in the `explorer-data` volume. The frontend is
available at `http://explorer.localhost`, with its GraphQL API at `http://explorer.localhost/graphql`. These third-party
components are intended for local development and are not part of the Miden node implementation.

## Note Transport

The [Miden Note Transport service](https://github.com/0xMiden/note-transport-service) exchanges private notes between
clients. Enable its optional profile explicitly:

```bash
docker compose --profile note-transport up -d
```

Its browser-facing gRPC-Web endpoint is `http://ntl.localhost`; native gRPC clients can use `localhost:57292`. Notes are
persisted in the `note-transport-data` volume.

The pinned Gateway FM image currently supports only `linux/amd64`. Compose selects that platform explicitly, allowing
Docker to run it through emulation on ARM hosts. To use a compatible native build instead, set both
`MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_IMAGE` and `MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_PLATFORM`.

## Faucet

The faucet is maintained in the separate [0xMiden/faucet](https://github.com/0xMiden/faucet) repository and can lag
behind the node's protocol version. It is therefore excluded from the default stack. Enable its profile explicitly:

```bash
docker compose --profile faucet build faucet
docker compose --profile faucet up -d
```

For a repository checkout, the first run builds the exact upstream commit pinned in `compose/faucet.yml`. Node releases
publish an image built from the same pin, so the published Compose application can pull it without requiring a source
build.

On its first successful start, the service imports the native `MIDEN` faucet account created at genesis and stores its
client state in the `faucet-data` volume. Later starts reuse that state. The API is available at
`http://faucet.localhost/api` and the frontend at `http://faucet.localhost`.

## Monitoring and Traces

The bundled OpenTelemetry Collector receives traces from the local network. With the telemetry profile enabled, it
forwards traces to Tempo. Grafana is preconfigured with Tempo as a data source, so use `http://grafana.localhost` to
inspect traces when a request fails, stalls, or behaves differently than expected.

Container logs are still useful for startup failures and quick checks, but traces usually provide a better view of how a
request moved through the local network.

The network monitor at `http://monitor.localhost` provides a compact health view for the running local network.

## Prover Override

The default stack spins up an internal prover instance which means proving will happen locally. This can be overridden
to use an external prover by setting `MIDEN_REMOTE_PROVER_URL` when starting the stack. The URL must be reachable from
inside the Compose network.

```bash
MIDEN_REMOTE_PROVER_URL=http://<prover-host>:50051 make local-network-up
```

## Genesis Config Override

By default, the local network bootstraps from the bundled `genesis` Compose config in `compose/bootstrap.yml`. The
bootstrap service derives the public keys of the three validator services from their signing keys and passes them to
`miden-validator genesis` via `--validator.key` flags. The signing keys are insecure defaults defined in
`compose/validator.yml` and must never be used outside local development.

To replace it, create a Compose override file:

```yaml title="genesis.override.yml"
configs:
  genesis: !override
    file: /absolute/path/to/genesis.toml
```

Use that override with either the repository model or a published application:

```bash
make local-network-up COMPOSE_OVERRIDE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/genesis.override.yml

docker compose \
  -f oci://ghcr.io/0xmiden/miden-local-network:vX.Y.Z \
  -f /absolute/path/to/genesis.override.yml \
  up -d
```

The custom configuration is mounted into the bootstrap validator as `/genesis.toml` and passed to
`miden-validator genesis --config`. The validator set is not part of the configuration file: the bootstrap service
always commits the public keys corresponding to the three validator private keys via `--validator.key` flags. Override
those private keys with `MIDEN_VALIDATOR_1_SIGNING_KEY`, `MIDEN_VALIDATOR_2_SIGNING_KEY`, and
`MIDEN_VALIDATOR_3_SIGNING_KEY`, and the shared transaction encryption key with `MIDEN_VALIDATOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
(`miden-validator keygen` generates fresh key material).

This only affects validator bootstrap. If the local network has already been bootstrapped, delete the existing local
chain data before starting with a different genesis configuration:

```bash
make local-network-delete
```

## Storage Key Setup

The Compose bootstrap service runs the two-of-three storage key ceremony and validates each validator's output before
starting the network. This can take several minutes. For a faster local start, set
`MIDEN_VALIDATOR_USE_STORAGE_KEY_FIXTURE=true` to use the committed insecure fixture instead. The fixture is public test
data and must never be used outside local development.

To exercise the production ceremony and Iroh document locally, build the validator image and run the opt-in check:

```bash
make docker-build-validator
docker compose --profile golden-dkg run --rm golden-dkg-check
```

This runs the production proof backend and can take several minutes. It does not replace the fixture used by normal
local startup.

## Check the RPC API

The RPC server exposes gRPC reflection. With `grpcurl` installed, a basic status check looks like:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:57291 rpc.Api/Status
```

Note the `-plaintext` flag, the local network does not use TLS.

Use the [gRPC API](./rpc/) section for the public RPC surface and streaming endpoints.
