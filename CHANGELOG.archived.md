## v0.15.0-rc.0 (2026-06-03)

This release is a major step in distributing the node and changes how node components are packaged, bootstrapped, and
operated.

### RPC API

- [BREAKING] Changed `GetBlockByNumber` to accept a `BlockRequest` with an optional `include_proof` flag and return a response containing the block and optional block proof ([#1864](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1864)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `GetNoteError` to `GetNetworkNoteStatus` and extended it to return the full lifecycle status of a network note (`Pending`, `Processed`, `Discarded`, `Committed`). Consumed notes are now retained in the database after block commit instead of being deleted ([#1892](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1892)).
- Extended `ValidatorStatus` with `chain_tip`, `validated_transactions_count`, and `signed_blocks_count` ([#1900](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1900)).
- Aligned `SyncNullifiers` list-limit validation in RPC and store with `nullifier_prefix` parameter semantics, and documented query parameter limits ([#1986](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1986)).
- Added public and store `Rpc` streaming endpoints for replica block/proof synchronization ([#1987](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1987)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `CheckNullifiers` endpoint ([#2049](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2049)).
- [BREAKING] `BlockRange.block_to` is now required for all RPC endpoints ([#2056](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2056)).
- [BREAKING] Reworked note proto types for multi-attachment support: `NoteMetadata` now carries `attachment_schemes` and `attachments_commitment` instead of a single `attachment`; `Note` and `NetworkNote` gained an `attachments` field; `NoteSyncRecord` now embeds full `NoteMetadata` instead of `NoteMetadataHeader`; and `NoteAttachmentKind` and `NoteMetadataHeader` were removed ([#2078](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2078)).
- [BREAKING] Changed `SyncChainMmr`: the upper end of the requested block range is now the chain tip with the requested finality level, and the response also returns the validator signature ([#2075](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2075)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `SubmitProvenTransaction` to `SubmitProvenTx` and `SubmitProvenBatch` to `SubmitProvenTxBatch` ([#2094](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2094)).
- [BREAKING] Fixed `proto::note::NoteHeader` so it round-trips losslessly; the wire field is now `details_commitment` instead of `note_id` ([#2132](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2132)).
- Allowed network transaction submission conditionally via `SubmitProvenTx` and `SubmitProvenTxBatch`: the NTX builder can now send a key in the `x-miden-network-tx-auth` header that enables submitting network transactions ([#2131](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/2131)).
- [BREAKING] `GetAccount` can now return all storage map entries with a single request ([#2121](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/2121)).
- Persisted attachments of private output notes when applying a block, so they are now returned by `GetNotesById` ([#2172](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2172)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced `StoreStatus` with `chain_tip` field in `RpcStatus` ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2187)).
- Added logic to disconnect slow block and proof stream clients ([#2196](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2196)).
- Added gRPC health check endpoint to node's RPC service ([#2188](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2188)).

### Docker

- Added `ca-certificates` to the node Docker runtime image so outbound `https` connections work in containerized deployments ([#1661](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/1661)).
- Added a Docker Compose setup for running a disposable local development network via `make local-network-*` targets, with support for custom genesis config bootstrap ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2159), [#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2185), [#2189](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2189)).

### Protocol

- [BREAKING] Updated the `miden-protocol` family of crates to the published `v0.15.0` release and bumped `miden-crypto` to `v0.25` ([#2095](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2095), [#2132](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2132)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed genesis config `storage_mode` to `account_type`, removed the `Network` storage variant, and changed the implicit default for wallets and fungible faucets to `Private` ([#2095](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2095)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the `has_updatable_code` field from genesis `[[wallet]]` config entries. Updatable/immutable code is no longer modeled by the protocol, so any genesis config that explicitly sets this field will fail to parse; remove the field.

### Node, Store, and Block Producer

- [BREAKING] Replaced binding URL env vars and CLI flags with listen socket addresses, and renamed `--url` flags and `*_URL` env vars to `--listen` and `*_LISTEN` across all components ([#2054](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2054)).
- [BREAKING] Unified node components into the `miden-node` binary ([#2119](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2119)).
    - Removed `miden-node store`.
    - Removed `miden-node rpc start`.
    - Removed `miden-node block-producer`.
    - Added `miden-node sequencer` for running the canonical block-producing node.
    - Added `miden-node full` for running a full node that streams blocks from an upstream sequencer and serves local RPC data.
    - Added top-level `miden-node bootstrap` and `miden-node migrate` lifecycle commands for node initialization and migrations.
- Made SQLite connection pool sizes configurable for store, validator, and ntx-builder components, defaulting each to twice the available CPU core count ([#2098](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2098)).
- Fixed block producer mempool panic when selecting transactions that depend on notes created by pruned committed transactions ([#2097](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2097)).

### Validator

- [BREAKING] Removed `miden-node validator` subcommand and created a separate `miden-validator` binary ([#2053](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2053)).

### Network Transaction Builder

- [BREAKING] Removed `miden-node ntx-builder` subcommand and created a separate `miden-ntx-builder` binary ([#2067](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2067)).
- Implemented filtering based on the network account note script root allowlist in ntx-builder ([#2042](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/2042)).
- Added `miden-ntx-builder bootstrap` commands for initializing the ntx-builder database from either node RPC or a trusted genesis block file. The `start` command now requires a bootstrapped database ([#2149](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2149)).
- Added `--tx-expiration-delta` (env `MIDEN_NODE_NTX_BUILDER_TX_EXPIRATION_DELTA`, default `30`) to the network transaction builder. Submitted network transactions now expire on-chain after this many blocks, and the builder reuses the same delta as the local window before resubmitting a transaction that has not landed ([#2148](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2148)).
- The ntx-builder now persists the genesis commitment at bootstrap and sends it in the RPC `Accept` header so the node accepts its write transactions ([#2162](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2162)).
- [BREAKING] `miden-ntx-builder` now requires a remote transaction prover to be configured ([#2179](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2179)).

## v0.14.11 (2026-05-19)

- Replaced blocking-in-async operations in the validator, remote prover, and ntx-builder with `spawn_blocking` to avoid starving the Tokio runtime ([#2041](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2041)).
- Implement persistent RocksDB backend for `AccountStateForest`, improving startup time ([#2020](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2020)).
- Fixed network transaction builder permanently dropping notes after transient infrastructure failures. These now retry with exponential backoff at the actor level instead of consuming per-note retry budget ([#2052](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/2052)).

## v0.14.10 (2026-04-29)

- Optimize `GetAccount` implementation to serve vault assets from `AccountStateForest` ([#1981](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1981)).
- Added `accept`, `origin`, `user-agent`, `forwarded`, `x-forwarded-for` and `x-real-ip` headers to telemetry for gRPC requests ([#1982](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1982)).
- Trace additional RPC request properties e.g. `account.id` in `GetAccount` ([#1983](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1983)).
- Fixed occasional mempool panic during transaction submission, causing the lock to be held for longer than expected ([#1984](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1984)).
- Optimize `GetAccount` implementation: `all_entries` requests now mostly use state from `AccountStateForest` ([#2012](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/2012)).

## v0.14.9 (2026-04-21)

- Simplified network monitor counter script loading by linking the counter module directly via `with_linked_module` instead of assembling a standalone library ([#1957](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1957)).

## v0.14.8 (2026-04-19)

- Fixed a startup race in the network transaction builder that could panic the chain MMR when a block committed between subscribing to the mempool and fetching the chain tip from the store ([#1953](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1953)).
- Enabled `miden-tx/concurrent` feature across all crates ([#1956](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1956)).

## v0.14.7 (2026-04-15)

- [BREAKING] Aligned proto `TransactionHeader` with domain type and exposed erased notes in `SyncTransactions` ([#1941](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1941)).
- Improved LargeSmt RocksDB defaults, added per-DB memory-budget controls, and exposed durability mode selection ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1947)).

## v0.14.6 (2026-04-10)

- Fixed network monitor explorer health check failing to parse string-encoded numeric fields from the Explorer GraphQL API ([#1922](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1922)).

## v0.14.5 (2026-04-10)

- Removed `issuance` field from the network monitor's faucet `GetMetadataResponse` ([#1918](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1918)).

## v0.14.4 (2026-04-08)

- Added missing `AuthControlled::allow_all()` mint policy component to genesis faucet accounts ([#1903](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1903)).

## v0.14.3 (2026-04-07)

- Fixed `SyncTransactions` failing when transactions created notes that were erased within the same block ([#1899](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1899)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated to `miden-protocol` v0.14.3 (update to `miden-vm` v0.22.1).

## v0.14.2 (2026-04-07)

- Added `block_header` field to `SyncChainMmrResponse` so clients can obtain the `block_to` block header without a separate request ([#1881](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1881)).
- Added inclusion proofs to `SyncTransactions` output notes ([#1893](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1893)).

## v0.14.1 (2026-04-02)

- Fixed batch building issue with unauthenticated notes consumed in the same batch as they were created ([#1875](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/1875)).

## v0.14.0 (2026-04-01)

- Added verbose `info!`-level logging to the network transaction builder for transaction execution, note filtering failures, and transaction outcomes ([#1770](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1770)).
- [BREAKING] Move block proving from Blocker Producer to the Store ([#1579](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1579)).
- [BREAKING] Updated miden-protocol dependencies to use `next` branch; renamed `NoteInputs` to `NoteStorage`, `.inputs()` to `.storage()`, and database `inputs` column to `storage` ([#1595](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1595)).
- Validator now persists validated transactions ([#1614](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1614)).
- [BREAKING] Remove `SynState` and introduce `SyncChainMmr` ([#1591](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/1591)).

### Changes

- [BREAKING] Removed obsolete `SyncState` RPC endpoint; clients should use `SyncNotes`, `SyncNullifiers`, `SyncAccountVault`, `SyncAccountStorageMaps`, `SyncTransactions`, or `SyncChainMmr` instead ([#1636](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1636)).

- Improved tracing span fields ([#1650](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1650))
- Replaced NTX Builder's in-memory state management with SQLite-backed persistence; account states, notes, and transaction effects are now stored in the database and inflight state is purged on startup ([#1662](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1662)).
- [BREAKING] Reworked `miden-remote-prover`, removing the `worker`/`proxy` distinction and simplifying to a `worker` with a request queue ([#1688](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1688)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `NoteRoot` protobuf message used in `GetNoteScriptByRoot` gRPC endpoints into `NoteScriptRoot` ([#1722](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1722)).
- NTX Builder actors now deactivate after being idle for a configurable idle timeout (`--ntx-builder.idle-timeout`, default 5 min) and are re-activated when new notes target their account ([#1705](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1705)).
- [BREAKING] Modified `TransactionHeader` serialization to allow converting back into the native type after serialization ([#1759](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/issues/1759)).

- Moved bootstrap procedure to `miden-node validator bootstrap` command ([#1764](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1764)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `bundled` command; each component is now started as a separate process. Added `ntx-builder` CLI subcommand. Added `docker-compose.yml` for local multi-process deployment ([#1765](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1765)).
- NTX Builder now deactivates network accounts which crash repeatedly (configurable via `--ntx-builder.max-account-crashes`, default 10) ([#1712](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1712)).
- Removed gRPC reflection v1-alpha support ([#1795](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1795)).
- [BREAKING] Rust requirement bumped from `v1.91` to `v1.93` ([#1803](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1803)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `SyncNotes` endpoint to returned multiple note updates (([#1843](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1843))).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `NoteSyncRecord` to returned a fixed-size `NoteMetadataHeader` ([#1837](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1837)).

### Fixes

- Fixed `GetAccount` returning an internal error for `AllEntries` requests on storage maps where all entries are in a single block (e.g. genesis accounts) ([#1816](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1816)).
- Fixed `GetAccount` returning empty storage map entries instead of `too_many_entries` when a genesis account's map exceeds the pagination limit ([#1816](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1816)).

## v0.13.9 (2026-03-26)
