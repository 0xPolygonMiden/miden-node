# Miden funding service

`miden-funding-service` is a Miden node binary that sends the chain's native asset to any account that asks for it.

## Operation

The service holds no chain state. It reads the funding account from the node, so a restart needs no recovery. Only the
account file, which holds the account ID and its signing key, is on disk.

The `Status` endpoint reports the funding account, its balance, and the block that balance was read at. An operator
alerts on that balance, because the service does not refill itself.

The service does not authenticate requests. An operator must restrict access to its gRPC API at the infrastructure
level.
