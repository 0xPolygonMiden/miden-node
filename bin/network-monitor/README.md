# Miden network monitor

`miden-network-monitor` is a dashboard and health-check binary for Miden network infrastructure. It is part of the Miden
node repository; see the [repository README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) for the overall project layout.

## Role

The monitor checks the health and freshness of services around a Miden network. Depending on its configuration, it can
monitor:

- the public node RPC API;
- remote prover services;
- a faucet service;
- an explorer endpoint;
- a note transport service;
- the validator service;
- an end-to-end network transaction flow using temporary in-memory accounts.

The monitor serves a web dashboard and can emit OpenTelemetry traces when standard OTLP environment variables are
configured.

## Operation

The monitor is an observer and test client, not a node component required for block production. Its network transaction
checks create fresh in-memory accounts on startup and do not persist account state to disk.

Network transaction checks also require `MIDEN_MONITOR_VALIDATOR_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY`. It must contain the hex-encoded
validator key that signs transaction encryption key attestations. The monitor will not submit a transaction unless it
can verify the advertised encryption key.

On a chain with a non-zero verification base fee, network transaction checks additionally require
`MIDEN_MONITOR_FUNDING_SERVICE_URL`: the monitor funds its in-memory accounts from the funding service and tops the
balance up automatically when it runs low. Without it the monitor refuses to start its network transaction checks on
such chains. `MIDEN_MONITOR_FAUCET_URL` is only used for the faucet checks.

Use the binary help output for the current command and configuration surface. The help output is the source of truth for
flags and environment variables.
