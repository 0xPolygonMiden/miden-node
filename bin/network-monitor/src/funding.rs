//! Fee funding for the monitor's accounts.
//!
//! Fees are withdrawn from the executing account's vault, so on a fee-charging chain the
//! monitor's fresh accounts need the fee asset before they can transact. This module requests a
//! P2ID note which holds the fee asset and returns it for consumption as an unauthenticated input
//! note.
//!
//! The funding service is the only source of the fee asset. The chain's faucet is not used for
//! fees, because a network does not always run a public faucet. The monitor still talks to the
//! faucet for its faucet checks, which is what [`FaucetClient`] is for.
