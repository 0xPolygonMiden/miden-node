# Proto Files Organization

These protobuf files are part of the [Miden node](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) repository.

The files are organized by a visibility hierarchy. The root directory contains the public-facing RPC and remote prover
protocols, while the `types` directory contains the data types used by these protocols. The `internal` directory
contains the internal protocols used by the node, such as non-transactional data and validator protocols.

The organization of the files is as follows:

```text
rpc.proto
remote_prover.proto
funding_service.proto
types/
├── primitives.proto
└── xxx.proto
internal/
├── ntx_builder.proto
└── validator.proto
```

The public-facing files should only allow the usage of the `types` directory, to avoid service reflection to internal
protocols.
