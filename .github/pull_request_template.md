## Changelog

<!--
Use one [[entry]] per release-note-worthy impact. If this PR does not change the public gRPC
interface or released binaries, replace the entry block with:

```toml
changelog = "none"
reason    = "Internal change only."
```

Do not add an entry for a protocol, Rust MSRV, or database migration version update. Release notes
derive these updates from repository files.

Allowed scopes: rpc, docs, node, note-transport, network-monitor, funding-service, ntx-builder, prover, validator, internal, general
Allowed impacts: breaking, added, changed, fixed, removed, deprecated
-->

```toml
[[entry]]
scope       = ""
impact      = ""
description = ""
```
